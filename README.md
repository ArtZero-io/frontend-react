# ArtZero Front-end Repo

## Introduction

The ArtZero platform aims to be a decentralized NFT marketplace on the AlephZero blockchain. It aims to allow the users to list their NFT collections to be tradeable on the platform for a fee and to create their NFT collection via the ArtZero contracts. The users can create the collections as standard NFT collections or in an advanced mode, which also serves as a launchpad for such projects. The platform also comes with its native NFT Collection, which owners can stake for platform fees and other perks.
